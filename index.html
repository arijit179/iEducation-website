                may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban
                areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools.
                
                At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government
                run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.As per the Annual
                Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were
                enrolled in school. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which
                    fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under various
                    articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
                    2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. State
                    governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the
                    number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.</p>

                    <p class="sectionSubTag">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central
                        government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved by the Union
                        Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.
                        
                        The National Education Policy 2020 has ‘emphasised’ on the use of mother tongue or local language as the
                        medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond.[30]It
                        also states that no language will be imposed on the students.The language policy in NEP is a broad
                        guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the
                implementation.</p>
